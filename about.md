I am a M.Sc. student at [Sharif University of Technology](https://sharif.edu). Currently, I am a member of the Data and Network Security Laboratory (DNSL), and my research is focused  on the combination of blockchain layer 2 solutions with Internet of Things devices.

I received my bachelor degree from the [Computer and Electrical Engineering department](https://ece.iut.ac.ir/) at [Isfahan University of Technology](http://iut.ac.ir/).

## Research

I have a broad interest in the security aspects of decentralized systems such as blockchains and cryptocurrencies. Currently, I am working on layer 2 solutions, specifically the Lightning Network, and their integration with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, with a particular focus on enabling secure micropayments.
