<b>Abstract</b>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:1.6;">

Vehicular data monetization is expected to revolutionize the automotive industry by unlocking the immense value generated by
connected vehicles. However, this shift also raises significant challenges around privacy, security, and ethical governance of such
data. This paper examines over 100 scholarly and industry contributions to explore how emerging technologies, such as blockchain
and edge computing, are shaping this space and their impact on
data breaches, re-identification attacks, and vague data ownership.
Detailed discussion of privacy-preserving mechanisms and comprehensive threat models is presented in the paper to highlight the
limitations of the existing practices. Beyond the technical aspects,
the ethical and legal challenges, such as consent management and
fair compensation for data sharing, have been discussed as well.
Findings of this study offer a comprehensive overview of the current
landscape and underline the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to build secure, efficient, and ethically grounded vehicular data
marketplaces.
