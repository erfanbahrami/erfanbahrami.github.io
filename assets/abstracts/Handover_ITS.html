<b>Abstract</b>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:1.6;">

The proliferation of Intelligent Transportation Systems has created unprecedented authentication challenges due to highly dynamic vehicular environments characterised by frequent topology changes, heterogeneous participant capabilities, and stringent real-time latency constraints. Existing authentication protocols do not address the fundamental limitation of treating authentication as a binary cryptographic decision, lacking the behavioural context necessary to detect malicious insiders with valid credentials. This paper presents a comprehensive trust-enhanced authentication protocol that integrates machine learning-derived trust assessment with blockchain-based verification to enable secure and efficient authentication in heterogeneous vehicular networks. The protocol implements a two-phase architecture distinguishing comprehensive initial authentication from lightweight handover procedures, achieving 47.52 milliseconds computation time for network entry and 12.59 milliseconds latency for inter-RSU handovers, representing a 16.8-fold improvement over B-HAS at 211.92 milliseconds. The protocol incorporates behavioural trust scores from our previously published MLT framework into authentication decisions, enabling graduated access control that dynamically adapts network privileges based on vehicle behavioural history. The blockchain-integrated trust context migration ensures seamless authentication state transfer across RSU boundaries, whilst adaptive authentication mechanisms accommodate both resource-rich vehicular OBUs and resource-constrained pedestrian IoT devices. Formal security verification using game-based reduction proofs under the Real-or-Random model and automated verification through Scyther demonstrates provable security against replay attacks, impersonation attempts, Sybil attacks, and malicious insider threats. Performance evaluation reveals communication overhead of 1088 bits for handover authentication, with 95 per cent trust score cache hit rate reducing blockchain query overhead from 45 milliseconds to 0.5 milliseconds, maintaining authentication latency below 100 milliseconds across network densities whilst satisfying ITS requirements for seamless high-mobility vehicular connectivity.
